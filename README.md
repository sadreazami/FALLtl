Radar-based fall detection using transfer learning

We propose a fall detection using radar return signals and transfer learning. A time-frequency representation of the radar signal is obtained and used to retrained the top layers of the VGG16 pretrained network. We fine-tuned the last few convolutional layers using radar spectrograms.
